/*
    Some of the triky questions
*/
1) How to ensure that a certain value is returned to the calling function even if an error/exception/fatal/panic has occured
   inside that function?
A: Use Panic-Recover-Defer and use named return values, just set the value to be returned to the named variable, go will do the rest.

2) Functions vs method

3) make() vs new()
A: make is only used to create arrays, slices and maps where new is used to create structs. Also new() returns the pointer to the newly
   created entity where as make doesn't do so.

4) string vs free string
